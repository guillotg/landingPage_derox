            <h1>Terms and Conditions of Use for DEROX Digital Platform</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 15, 2026</p>

            <p>This document constitutes a binding agreement between the user (hereinafter "USER" or "YOU") and ABG Tech
                Capital Inc. (hereinafter "THE COMPANY") establishing the terms and conditions (hereinafter the
                "AGREEMENT") for the use and enjoyment of the DEROX Digital Platform (hereinafter "DEROX"). This
                AGREEMENT applies to all activities and interactions performed by the USER within DEROX, related mobile
                applications, and all other linked services (hereinafter the "SERVICES").</p>

            <h2>Use of the DEROX Platform</h2>
            <p>The platform provides our users with a health guide and offers many features such as the following:
                personalized health assistance and information, symptom tracking functionality, and access to our
                medical database ("Medical Library") powered by DEROX's unique artificial intelligence system.</p>
            <p>Health guidance and assistance is available as an application that can be downloaded for free via your
                mobile device (hereinafter the "DEROX App"), and (where available) via our web-based application
                (hereinafter the "Website"). DEROX has also developed an assessment tool (hereinafter referred to as
                "Assessment Tool") and related services. The Website, the DEROX App, and the Assessment Tool, including
                any software, service, or other technology on which they are based, will hereinafter be referred to as
                the "DEROX Platform".</p>
            <p>The DEROX platform offers you the opportunity to find out your health status, as well as giving you
                lifestyle recommendations based on your answers (without substituting the advice or counsel of a medical
                expert with a medical license). The DEROX Platform uses a document base containing medical and
                scientific knowledge for wellness recommendations (hereinafter, the "Assessment Report").</p>
            <p>The DEROX platform is provided to you through various distribution channels and allows you to make an
                unlimited number of requests for health assistance, recommendations, and assessment.</p>
            <p>Please note that we provide the DEROX platform solely for informational purposes. It is not a medical
                consultation. The DEROX platform is not a suitable substitute for medical advice obtained from your
                doctor, general practitioner, or other health service provider. The DEROX platform DOES NOT provide
                diagnoses for medical conditions, nor does it prescribe how to treat any medical problem you may have.
                This can only be done by consulting a medical professional.</p>

            <h2>Referential Use and Liability</h2>
            <p><strong>Referential Use:</strong> The information provided by the macronutrient tool is only an estimate
                and depends on the data entered by the user. There may be variations in calculations due to differences
                in preparation, ingredients, and serving sizes.</p>
            <p><strong>User Liability:</strong> All decisions related to food and nutrition are the sole responsibility
                of the user, so it is their obligation to verify the validity and reliability of the information
                provided by the macronutrient tool with a health or nutrition professional. The tool does not replace
                the advice of a health or nutrition professional.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, if you have any medical issues related to the information you have entered into the DEROX
                Platform, you are responsible for whether or not to consult a medical professional, and therefore you
                hereby release THE COMPANY from any damage, direct or indirect, that may originate from the use of DEROX
