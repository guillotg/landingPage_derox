            <p>Dear Customer, Subscriber, Instructor, Provider and/or Worker:</p>
            <p>In accordance with the provisions of the Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private
                Parties (the “Law”), and in compliance with the obligation of ABG Tech Capital Inc. (hereinafter
                “DEROX”) consisting of protecting the personal data of its clients, subscribers, instructors,
                associates, workers, providers and/or beneficiaries of any of the products, services or contracts
                belonging to the operation of our consulting company, we inform you of the following:</p>

            <h2>Types of Data Accessed or Collected</h2>
            <p>Our application, DEROX, accesses and processes health-related data to provide management tools and
                personalized recommendations. The data collected or accessed includes, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul class="clean-list">
                <li><strong>Personal Identifiers:</strong> (such as name, email, and date of birth) to create user
                    profiles.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Metrics:</strong> (such as height, weight, activity level, blood pressure, active
                    calories burned, distance, exercise session, floors climbed, steps, speed, respiratory rate, basal
                    metabolic rate, body fat, total calories burned, hydration, nutrition, sleep session, blood glucose,
                    blood pressure, body temperature, oxygen saturation, resting heart rate, and heart rate) to
                    calculate personalized health scores and provide actionable recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Such as the approximate or precise location of the device. The
                    specific use of this data is detailed below.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> (such as interactions within the application) to improve the user
                    experience and optimize the functionality of the application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Purpose of Data Use</h2>
            <p>The collected data is used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul class="clean-list">
                <li>Providing ultra-personalized health recommendations.</li>
                <li>Monitoring and analyzing health trends over time.</li>
                <li>Enabling functions such as the Medical Log, Health Family Tree, and DEROX Score for preventative
                    health management.</li>
                <li>Improving user experience and application performance through the analysis of aggregated data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Specific Use of Location Data</h2>
            <p>To offer a complete and functional experience, our application may request access to your device's
                location data. Below, we detail comprehensively how and why we access, collect, and use this
                information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration with Health Platforms (Google Health Connect):</strong> The main functionality
                    of our app depends on synchronization with health services like Google Health Connect. The Health
                    Connect API requires location permission to discover and establish secure connections with nearby
                    devices and health sensors. Without this permission, automatic synchronization of key data may not
                    work correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Personalization and AI Algorithms:</strong> We use location data to contextualize
                    your activity and offer you more accurate and relevant recommendations. This allows the
                    personalization of the AI and the app's information to be significantly more effective for you. It
                    is important to emphasize that location data is used exclusively for the functional purposes
                    mentioned. We do not sell or share your precise location data with third parties for advertising
                    purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Secure Data Handling</h2>
            <p>We apply industry-standard security measures to protect user data, including encryption protocols for
                data transmission and storage. Access to sensitive data is limited solely to authorized personnel.</p>
